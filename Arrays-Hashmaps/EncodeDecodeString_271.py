# String Encode and Decode
# Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is then decoded back to the original list of strings.

# Please implement encode and decode

# Example 1:

# Input: ["neet","code","love","you"]

# Output:["neet","code","love","you"]
# Example 2:

# Input: ["we","say",":","yes"]

# Output: ["we","say",":","yes"]
# Constraints:

# 0 <= strs.length < 100
# 0 <= strs[i].length < 200
# strs[i] contains only UTF-8 characters.

# Solution:
# create a string where every word is appended together and instead of spaces append the length of a string and a '#'
# To decode loop through the string and find '#' and then find the next '#' and then grab that word and append to return array
# Pretty simple solution, for something more complicated this can be done through a hashing algorithm like MD5 or SHA-256 (which is done through bit operations)
